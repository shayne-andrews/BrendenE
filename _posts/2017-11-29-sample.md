Hey Shayne, you will be able to make a fork and pull request for this blog as long as you did not pick the same theme as well. In order to edit this sample post you will need to fork my repo, and then within the _posts folder this text is found in the file 2017-11-29-sample.md.

Hey Brendan, I found it! If your reading this it also meands I successfully made an edit!   
Maybe you should rename the file to the current date?
